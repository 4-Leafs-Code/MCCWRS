        <h4>Empowering Women with Futures</h4>
        <h6>Mission Statement</h6>
        <p>To provide women with the opportunities and support they need to reintegrate back into the community successfully.
        We recognize that women offenders have unique pathways to their crimes, and because of that, we will assess and program with a gender-responsive and trauma-informed approach.
        We will focus on educational and vocational opportunities and growth, while we encourage the reunification and development of the family and natural supports.

          <p>
            Listen for your walk to be called<br>
            You will have thirty (30) minutes to eat your meal, including movement to and from the chow hall<br>
            Move efficiently through the line and be respectful that others must access drink fountain and salad bar behind you<br>
            Clean up after yourself<br>
          </p>
          <h4>Utensils</h4>
          <p>
            A utensil set will be issued from the kitchen when you attend your first meal and will include an orange plastic:  spoon, fork, and knife<br>
            Bring them with you to each meal as utensils are not offered at the service window<br>
            You can make a utensil holder to carry them<br>
            If you lose them, you will be charged $2.50/piece or $5.00/set for replacements<br>
          </p>
          <h4>Allowed</h4>
          <p>
            You can bring condiments (peanut butter, pickles, jelly, etc.), wraps, and ready-to-drink coffee (no loose ingredients) and they must be taken back to the unit when finished eating<br>
            Picnic tables are provided for eating outside during lunch and dinner, weather permitting and c/o discretion:<br>
            A c/o may decide the area will not be utilized during meals<br>
            Pick up after yourselves<br>
            The door is not always propped open, so you may need to knock to be let in<br>
          </p>
          <h4>Prohibited</h4>
          <p>
            Do not bring your drinking bottles to chow and fill with fountain drinks or water<br>
            Do not bring bowls into the chow hall, either empty or containing prepared foods from unit<br>

          </p>
          <h4>Special Diets</h4>
          <p>
            If you require a special diet, you must notify medical, so they can submit a “Dietary Restrictions” order form to the kitchen. Failure to adhere to the restrictions will be grounds for suspension of the order.<br>
            Special diets expire and must be renewed on a regular basis, so know when you need to put in a slip to medical to be seen again and renew the order<br>
          </p>
          <h4>Food Allergies</h4>
          <p>
          If you have any food allergies you must notify medical, so they can submit an “Allergy Restriction” order form to the kitchen.<br>
            It is your responsibility to ensure that you confirm potential allergens before ingesting them, as food is prepared off-site and SMWRC can’t always guarantee the food ingredients<br>
            Alternatives will be provided for those with allergies but be patient with kitchen staff as options are limited to what is on hand or sent from off-site<br>
            Restrictions expire and must be renewed on a regular basis, so know when you need to put in a slip to medical to be seen again and renew the order<br>
