                                        <p>The Bachelor of Science in Information and Library Science provides students an opportunity to develop
                                        technological skills, attain a broad liberal arts education, and increase creative and critical thinking
                                        abilities for employment in libraries and information centers. It is the natural extension of the Associate of
                                        Science in ILS offered by UMA. Students with the Bachelor’s degree will be prepared to enter the field of
                                        library and information technology as specialized paraprofessionals, able to work independently in many
                                        employment settings. Library support staff and technicians currently employed in school and public libraries can
                                        advance themselves professionally and fiscally by pursuing the B.S. in ILS. The B.S. degree also prepares
                                        students for further study in Information and Library Science at the Graduate level.<br>Entrance Requirements:
                                        To be admitted to the Bachelor of Science degree, either Option 1 or Option 2 must be met. If neither is
                                        possible, all students will follow Option 3.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Option 1:</span> Successful completion of 30 credits from an accredited
                                        institution with a GPA of at least 2.50<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Option 2:</span>  SATs of 1,000 combined points<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Option 3:</span> Students who do
                                        not meet either of the first two criteria will be required to enter into the A.S. degree program. After
                                        successfully completing 30 credits, students may transfer into the B.S. degree.<br>Program Requirements:
                                        Additionally, as part of the ILS 499 Senior Capstone Course, students are required to do an internship
                                        consisting of 120 hours on-site at a library under the supervision of an MLS librarian. While many of our
                                        students have extensive backgrounds in ILS, the internship is still required and many students find this a great
                                        opportunity to explore a new area of library science they have not been able to experience.</p>

                                            University of Maine Law School offer a joint accelerated 3+3 program for UMA students interested in pursuing a
                                            legal career. <br>In collaboration with the Business Administration Program, JUS offers a minor and certificate
                                            in Fraud Examination, which enables the student to sit for the national fraud exam; and in collaboration with
                                            the Computer Information Systems Program, an Information Security Certificate, which prepares the student to
                                            work in cyber-security. <br>The program also offers an Advocacy Minor for students to research, present, and
                                            defend their cause in any law-related forum—court, legislature, and administrative agencies.</p>
                                        <p>Many Justice Studies students are returning students whose academic education was interrupted by parenthood,
                                            military service, or the economy and who bring their family and work commitments with them. To accommodate those
                                            needs, the Justice Studies program offers the majority of its courses online. Some live and video conference
                                            classes are available in Augusta, Bangor and UMA Centers and sites.
                                            The program also gives academic credit for selected military and police training and accepts CLEP and Dantes
                                            exams results for academic credit. The program allows students with course-related employment experience to
                                            challenge those particular courses by exam or portfolio.
                                            The Maine Community Policing Institute (MCPI) provides education, training, and technical assistance to
                                            members of the public and the police who protect them with the goal of creating proactive problem solving to
                                            enhance community wellbeing and quality of life through public safety partnerships.</p>

                                        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Course Delivery</span> - Many MHHS students are returning students whose academic education was interrupted by
                                            parenthood, military service, or the economy and who bring their family and work commitments with them. To

                                            of the courses online.</p>

                                            support, coordinating support services, identifying and solving problems, and more.</p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sequence of Courses</span> - All University degrees have a specific curriculum which is made up of several components:
                                            Core and General Education, Program Requirements, Program Electives and General Electives. How a student goes
                                            about completing the curriculum is determined by where the student starts.<br>If you are just entering college
                                            we recommend taking your Core and General Education requirements during the first two years that you are here.
                                            That will ensure that you are fully prepared to take other courses later in your academic career.<br>If you are
                                            transferring into the program once your prior credits have been assessed, it will be important to make sure that
                                            you have completed the Core and General Education courses.<br>Regardless of which pathway brought you here,
                                            progressing through program requirements and electives is rather straight forward. We have simplified the
                                            process of selecting courses to ensure both continuity and choice for the student. The fundamental principle is
                                            to follow the numbers. Students are encouraged to take 100-level classes initially. These courses are general in
                                            nature and provide an entry into more advanced classes. 200-hundred level classes are primarily designed to
                                            develop and enhance skills and knowledge useful for more advanced classes. 300-level classes typically are
                                            building upon earlier courses. Finally, 400 level classes should be taken once the student has completed most of
                                            their undergraduate education. These courses prepare the student for the internship/capstone experience, then
                                            graduation and entry into either the profession or further education for a more advanced degree.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A special
                                                note regarding general electives.</span><br>The baccalaureate degree program in Mental Health and Human Services has
                                            many required classes, hence limiting the number of electives (5, three-credit courses). Students, particularly
                                            those transferring into the program, should be very cautious about taking courses that do not directly lead to
                                            the degree.<br>UMA’s Mental Health and Human Services’ Associate of Science degree is integrated within our
                                            baccalaureate program. Students can pursue a variety of potential career paths and earn an Associate’s degree
                                            along the way. The sequence of taking courses should be the same as the baccalaureate degree; take the Core and
                                            General Education courses during the first year and then follow the numbers, take the 100-level, then 200-level
                                            and finally the 300-level courses. Once you have fulfilled the required prerequisite courses you will need to
                                            take HUS 223 Fieldwork Preparation and then HUS 270 Fieldwork Placement I.</p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Criminal Background Check Policy:</span> Many agencies that provide mental health and human services field placement
                                            opportunities for students require a criminal background check. If a criminal background check indicates a
                                            conviction, this conviction may prevent you from securing a field placement, which is a required component of
                                            our degree programs. A conviction may also negatively impact your ability to get licensure to practice in the
                                            field of behavioral health. It is recommended that you contact the Licensure Board in the state(s) you plan to
                                            practice receiving specific information regarding their requirements. Other types of background checks, such as
                                            child protection or driving history, may be identified and required by the organization that is considering you
                                            for a field placement. If you have any doubts, please initiate a criminal background check yourself. This may
                                            include a Department of Motor Vehicle check as well.</p>

                                            from, to develop a solid foundation in the humanities, social sciences, mathematics, and natural sciences.
                                            Students then choose a minor, rather than a major, in one area.</p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Career Outcomes</span> - Students with a Liberal Arts degree are poised to be successful in a number of areas, as it
                                            prepares thoughtful and creative readers, writers, thinkers, and problem solvers. Our majors go into business,
                                            education, government, health fields, and social/human services and policy. There really is no career area that
                                            isn’t served by a Liberal Studies degree.</p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Outcomes</span> - Graduates of the program will have the following:<br>effective verbal and written

                                        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Year / Freshman In the first year</span>, students typically take ENG 101:  College Writing, designed to prepare
                                            for a variety of academic writing.  This is followed by ENG 102W:  Introduction to Literature, which introduces
                                            fundamentals of literary analysis through close reading of poetry, short fiction, and drama. These two courses
                                            show students writing as a process, introduce research methods, and model critical reading skills. Math and lab
                                            sciences are also useful to complete early in a student’s course of study, as well as a communications class and
